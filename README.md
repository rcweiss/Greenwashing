# Greenwashing

This model screens environmental claims for potential greenwashing

To use, click the open in colab link at the top; then run all of the cells in order, wait for the previous cell to complete before running the next one.
The last cell has an input section at the bottom of the cell, input ur statement there, and it will screen for potential greenwashing 


This is the demo idea based program that gives an idea of what the potential could be in the future.
